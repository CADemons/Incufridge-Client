Incufridge-Client
=================

Java code for the Incufridge client.

# Usage

This code should be run from a raspberry pi connected to the Incufridge
There is a GUI, but it should not be used.
Instead, to interact with the fridge (making programs...) use the Incufridge App program (located [here](https://github.com/CADemons/Incufridge-App)).
